# OctoPrint-ScreenSquish

OctoPrint in a single column on your phone.  Or a little horizontally squished 
on your tablet.

This plugin just adds a little old-fashioned bootstrap v2 responsiveness (or
screen scalability if you prefer) to the UI that is already there.  While you're
building your nifty alternate UI or waiting for one from somebody else, this plugin
will make OctoPrint easier to use on your phone browser.
